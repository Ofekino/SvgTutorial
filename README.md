# React Native Svg Progress 

A simple Expo project that uses react-native-svg to create a cool icon progress bar.
Instead of just using an horizontal progress bar, use an Icon that fills up as the progress goes up!

Everything is in App.js, nothing else changed.

In order to change the SVG, simply replace the Path's `d` to your SVG's Path's `d` content.

*While this project is in Expo, you can use the same code in Bare React Native.
